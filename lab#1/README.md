## Prerequisites

### IDE and compiler
You can use whatever IDE/Text editor/CLI you want, but you'll have to write code by your own.
I recommend [CodeBlocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) as it is cross platform, it has a version which contains a compiler and it is less tempting to try drag-n-drop features.

#### If you chose CodeBlocks, here is how you start a project with it:

* Download. Better choose a version which has compiler.
* Install. After installation it will ask you to choose a default compiler. Do it wisely.
* File -> New -> Project -> Win32 GUI project -> Next...
* In order to see only GUI window without console, in Project properties, set Build targets -> Type -> GUI Application (project may need a rebuild)

#### Using VCS (`git` or SVN) and GitHub
You should be familiar with `git`, if not then take a look at [IDE Lab nr.1](https://github.com/TUM-FAF/IDE/blob/master/MIDPS_LAB_1.md).

Main purposes of `git`/GitHub are:
* Proof of your work
* Analyzing your progress and understanding of course
* Safe place to keep your work
* Delimiting development and ready work

By default you have one branch - `master`. I'll review only work from that branch.

The `master` branch should have the "main" (outer) README.md file, and you should add a .gitignore file.
* I recommend to copy .gitignore file from [WP Labs master branch](https://github.com/TUM-FAF/WP) or [the extended one](https://github.com/dlfcn-win32/dlfcn-win32/blob/master/.gitignore). Add additional rules in order not to submit unnecessary files to repository. **Do not submit executables and builds.**
* `README.md` (can be any other flavoured by GitHub extension) should contain at least the name of course and your name.

Create one folder per laboratory work. Use **lab#X** format (where X is laboratory work number). More about this you can find on [Submission Process page](https://github.com/TUM-FAF/WP/wiki/Submission-Process). An example of how your repository should look like can be seen [here](https://github.com/TUM-FAF/FAF-121-Istratii-Andrei/).

Before submission you can use other branches to work on your projects. You can use other branches in order to require help from me or other classmates.

#### Programming Style Guidelines (PSG)
It is a good practice to have a PSG. And a good solution is to take and use one available PSG.
For example:
* [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
* [Geotechnical Software Services C++ Programming Style Guidelines](http://geosoft.no/development/cppstyle.html)
* [USC Aerial Robotics Programming Style Guide (C++)](https://github.com/uscrs-art/uscrs-art/wiki)
* [C style guide](https://github.com/nickbjohnson4224/rhombus/wiki/C-style-guide)
* or write your own PSG

Whatever you choose, add a link to it in your master's branch readme file.
If you are going to write your own PSG, do not forget to add it into your master branch.

## Mandatory Objectives `(5pt)`

* Choose a _Programming Style Guideline_ that you'll follow
* Create a `Windows application`
* Add 2 `buttons` to window: one with default styles, one with custom styles (size, background, text color, font family, font size)
* Add 2 `text` elements to window: one with default styles, one with custom styles (size, background, text color, font family, font size) *[one of them should be something funny]*
* On windows resize, one of the `text`s should "reflow" and be in window's center (vertically and horizontally)

## Objectives With Points

* Add 2 text inputs to window: one with default styles, one with custom styles (size, background, text color, font family, font size) `(1pt)`
* Make elements to fit window on resize `(1 pt)`
_(hint: you can limit minimal window width and height)_
* Make elements to interact or change other elements (`1 pt` each different interactions) `(0-2 pt)` _(ex. on button click, change text element color or position)_
* Change behavior of different window actions (at least 3). For ex.: on clicking close button, move window to a random location on display's working space `(1 pt)`
* Write your own PSG (you can take existent one and modify it) and argue why it is better (for you) `(1 pt)`
