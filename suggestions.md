# Suggestions

## Report remarks

### About reports

* Do not put *(much)* code in your report
* Don't forget to use as an email topic which follows this pattern: [TUM][FAF Labs][WP] Name Surname
* Next time name your report file as - _WP FAF 111 Name Surname Lab#0_ (replace your name, surname and lab number)
* The Report should either be in `pdf` format (hopefully compiled used `Latex`), or `markdown`, contained in the `readme` of the given laboratory work folder.
* In your **email** - add a link to your lab repository (I know where it is, but it will be easier for me to locate your repository)
* Better use a report template provided in [repository](https://github.com/TUM-FAF/WP/)
* Don't forget to create a PSG (At least choose one existent that matches your style. If it has any differences - mention them.)
* Spellcheck your report/documentation/code (even if I don't do it always)
* Please change the number of laboratory work in `readme` and in `report`

### About repository/project

* Rename your folder names in your repository to follow **lab#0** pattern
* For each laboratory work add one README file (in its own folder)
* Keep your finished code in `master` branch. It is awesome that you get how to work with branches, but proposed work flow is a bit different: use master branch for submission ready code, and use other branches for development and testing. For details look at [submission process page](https://github.com/TUM-FAF/WP/wiki/Submission-Process)
* It seems that you compiled your project before adding .gitignore. Please remove unnecessary files from repository (foldes _bin_ and _obj_) and next time check your staged files before making a commit.
* Your readme file may be styled much better if you'll use appropriate [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax. You always may refresh your mind about markdown syntax simply by pressing keyboard key _m_ on any github page. Also you can live preview markdown text on [socrates.io](http://socrates.io/) even without Internet connection.
* It will be great if you'll add into your repository your project file, so it will be easier for me and anyone else (even you if you'll clone your work) to run your project. `CodeBlocks`'s project file has `.cbp` extension.
* Your project code is padded using tabs and spaces (it is not consistent and looks strange from an editor with different tab spacing (mine has 1 tab = 2 spaces)). Try to setup your project/IDE in such an order that it will be consistent.
* I wasn't able to run your project. Maybe it is because I don't have the right project file or environment. So please write in your `readme` on what kind of environment your applications is running, and what are additional steps that should be taken in order to run it (in there are any).

### General things

* Please make an effort and count your points
* Please next time count your points using provided table (there is a table in report template)
