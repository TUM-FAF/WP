# Laboratory Works' Presentation

## Title of Laboratory Works

Windows Programming

## Communication Language

English

## Programming Language

C/C++

## No Delays

Deadlines for laboratory works will not be delayed on students intention. However deadlines may be changed for other reasons.

## Other OSes

You may choose to do the same laboratory works for other OSes but:

- Your midterms and exams will be based on Win32 API
- You'll have to translate the tasks for your chosen environment

## Recommended IDE

`CodeBlocks` is a recommended IDE, hence many choose `Visual Studio IDE`. Either way you'll have to write code. **So no drag-n-dropping or XML defined layouts.**

## Documentation

Recommended documentation is _Windows Programming, 5th Edition by Charlez Petzold_ (don't confuse it with 6th edition). Many good things may be found on [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/) such as Win32 API structures, functions default parameters and returns.

## Solution Examples

_Windows Programming_ has many examples. Only those examples should be enough to complete laboratory works. Hence many other good things are on [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/), [CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com/) and probably other websites. Also many laboratory works from previous years are available in [our organization repository](https://github.com/TUM-FAF).
