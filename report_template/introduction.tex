\section{Purpose of the laboratory}
Gain knowledge about basics of event-driven programming, understanding of windowâ€™s class and basic possibilities of Win32 API. Also she will try to understand and process OS messages.
\section{Laboratory Work Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Mandatory Objectives \texttt{6pt}}
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Choose a \textit{Programming Style Guideline} that you'll follow
		      \item Create a \textbf{Windows application}
		      \item Add 2 \texttt{buttons} to window: one with default styles, one with custom styles (size, background, text color, font family, font size)
		      \item Add 2 \texttt{text} elements to window: one with default styles, one with custom styles (size, background, text color, font family, font size) \textit{[one of them should be something funny]}
		      \item On windows resize, one of the \texttt{text}s should "reflow" and be in window's center (vertically and horizontally)
	      \end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Objectives With Points:}
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item \texttt{(1pt)} Add 2 text inputs to window: one with default styles, one with custom styles (size, background, text color, font family, font size)
		      \item \texttt{(1pt)} Make elements to fit window on resize \textit{(hint: you can limit minimal window width and height)}
		      \item \texttt{(0-2pt)}Make elements to interact or change other elements (\texttt{1pt} each different interactions) \textit{(ex. on button click, change text element color or position)}
		      \item \texttt{(1pt)} Change behavior of different window actions (at least 3). For ex.: on clicking close button, move window to a random location on display's working space
		      \item \texttt{(1pt)} Write your own PSG (you can take existent one and modify it) and argue why it is better (for you)
