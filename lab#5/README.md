# Windows Programming Laboratory Work #5

## Title
Collaboration. Complex application.

## Contents
* Collaboration
* All previously studied things

## Mandatory Objectives
* Create an application which has:
  * Child windows controls
  * GDI animation
* Animation should be controlled by controls

## Objectives With Points
* Work on this project in a team of 2-4 `(2 pt)`
  * Divide tasks and describe them in readme (for each task indicate who is responsible for it) `(1 pt)`
  * Use `pull requests` in order to merge your code `(2 pt)`
* Make it useful (you may be asked (by me) to evaluate the usefulness of your application idea) `(0-3 pt)`
* First create a sketch, then work on code `(1 pt)` _(commit sketches early)_

## Some examples of application ideas
* [Cangourou/Furnica](http://torrentsmd.com/details.php?id=238851) simplified clone:
  * Define a simple pseudo language (movement ant rotation keywords) or not
  * Give ability to add action commands via text input box (if you defined a pseudo language) or some other smart way
  * Display/Run action (some element movement, mutation, effects)
* Airport scheduler:
  * Display a schedule of flights (with ability to modify them)
  * Display a map on which are displayed in real-time fling airplanes
  * Time travel (give ability to increase/decrease/revert time speed)
* Sea battle fight (only offline mode as network communication is outside of scope for this course)
* [Interactive Generative Art](http://weavesilk.com/)
  * Display something interactive and generative
  * Add some options to customize interactiveness or generated image
  * Add some options like save or load image
* [Code controlled game](http://morrisgames.info/)
  * Player should be controlled by programmable commands

In provided examples it is easy to divide tasks for 2: one may work on animation and the second one can work on controls.

You can use your creativity in order to modify any given idea or choose one absolutely different.

If you'll work in a team:
* I recommend to create new repository and use that to commit your code to
* Points that you'll gain will be assigned to each of members that participated in application development

## References
* search for any collaboration tutorial, but main idea is to have one common repository, divide tasks and work on them alone but for common purpose
